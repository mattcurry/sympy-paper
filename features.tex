% Features to discuss in-depth:
This section gives a basic introduction of SymPy, and lists its features.
A few features---assumptions, simplification, calculus, polynomials, printers,
solvers, and matrices---are core components of SymPy and are discussed in
depth. Many other features are discussed in depth in the supplementary
material.

\subsection{List of Features}

Although SymPy's extensive feature set cannot be covered in-depth in this
paper, calculus and other bedrock areas are discussed in their own
subsections. Additionally, Table~\ref{features-table} gives a compact listing
of all major capabilities present in the SymPy codebase. This grants a
sampling from the breadth of topics and application domains that SymPy
services. Unless stated otherwise, all features noted in
Table~\ref{features-table} are symbolic in nature. Numeric features are
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:numerics}.

3D function
plotting, and 2D implicit function plotting are supported.\\

Polynomials (\texttt{sympy.polys}) & Polynomial algebras over various coefficient domains.

or Unicode characters and converting SymPy expressions to \LaTeX{} and
MathML.\\

special sets such as the natural, integer, and complex numbers). Operations
on sets such as union, intersection, Cartesian product, and building sets from
other sets are supported.\\
